## #8 Data Persistence (localStorage)

### Summary
Implement automatic saving and loading of all user progress data using localStorage so players don't lose their progress when closing the browser.

### Background
The app was losing all progress (caught Pokémon, teams, levels, etc.) on page refresh because no persistence mechanism was implemented.

### Scope
- In-scope
  - Save all personaData to localStorage
  - Restore data on app initialization
  - Handle localStorage errors gracefully
  - Automatic saving on any data change

- Out-of-scope
  - Cloud/server synchronization
  - Import/export functionality
  - Data compression

### Technical Implementation
- Files touched:
  - `src/contexts/AppContext.tsx` - Added localStorage hooks

### User Story
**As a user, I want my progress to be saved automatically so that I don't lose my collection and progress when I close the browser.**

### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ All persona data automatically saved to localStorage
- ✅ Data restored when app loads
- ✅ Graceful handling of localStorage failures
- ✅ No performance impact from frequent saves
- ✅ Data integrity maintained across sessions

### Story Points: 3

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED
